DeepSeek Voice Feature Prototype

A comprehensive voice interface implementation for DeepSeek AI, enabling natural voice conversations through seamless speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis.

🎯 Overview

This prototype demonstrates a complete voice interaction system that allows users to speak naturally to DeepSeek AI and receive audible responses. The implementation features real-time speech processing, customizable voice settings, and an intuitive user interface.

🚀 Quick Start

Prerequisites

· Modern web browser (Chrome 70+, Edge 79+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+)
· Microphone access permissions
· Audio output capabilities

Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepseek-voice-feature.git
   cd deepseek-voice-feature
   ```
2. Open the prototype
   ```bash
   # Simply open the HTML file in your browser
   open voice-prototype.html
   
   # Or serve via local server for best performance
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000/voice-prototype.html
   ```
3. Allow microphone access when prompted by your browser

Basic Usage

1. Click the microphone button or press Ctrl+Shift+V to start listening
2. Speak your query naturally - you'll see real-time transcription
3. Wait for the AI response to be spoken back to you
4. Continue the conversation - the system stays in listening mode

🛠️ Integration with DeepSeek API

Current Implementation

The prototype currently uses simulated responses. Here's how to integrate with the actual DeepSeek API:

```javascript
// Replace the simulated response in voice-prototype.js
async processVoiceInput(transcript) {
    this.updateStatus('processing', 'Connecting to DeepSeek...');
    
    try {
        const response = await this.callDeepSeekAPI(transcript);
        this.speakResponse(response);
    } catch (error) {
        this.handleAPIError(error);
    }
}

async callDeepSeekAPI(userInput) {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.deepseek.com/chat', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userInput }],
            model: 'deepseek-chat',
            stream: false
        })
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

Environment Setup

```bash
# Add to your deployment environment
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DEEPSEEK_API_BASE=https://api.deepseek.com
```

🎛️ Customization

Voice Settings

· Speech Rate: 0.5x to 2.0x normal speed
· Voice Pitch: 0.5 (low) to 2.0 (high)
· Volume Control: 0.0 to 1.0
· Voice Selection: Multiple system voices available

UI Customization

```css
/* Custom color scheme */
.voice-interface {
    --primary-color: #10a37f;
    --listening-color: #ef4146;
    --speaking-color: #4285f4;
}
```

🌐 Browser Compatibility

Browser Speech Recognition Text-to-Speech Notes
Chrome ✅ Full support ✅ Full support Recommended
Edge ✅ Full support ✅ Full support Recommended
Firefox ⚠️ Limited ✅ Full support Requires flags
Safari ⚠️ Limited ✅ Full support Desktop only
Mobile Safari ❌ No support ✅ Full support iOS limitations

🐛 Troubleshooting

Common Issues

Microphone Access Denied

```javascript
// Solution: Ensure HTTPS and user permission
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
    .then(stream => { /* microphone available */ })
    .catch(error => { /* handle permission denied */ });
```

No Voices Available

· Chrome: Voices load asynchronously - wait a few seconds
· Firefox: Check about:flags for speech synthesis settings
· Safari: Ensure system voices are installed

Speech Recognition Not Working

· Use Chrome or Edge for best compatibility
· Check microphone permissions in browser settings
· Ensure page is served over HTTPS (required for microphone)

Debug Mode

Enable console logging for troubleshooting:

```javascript
window.voicePrototype.debug = true;
```
